# Database-Creation--SQL-Server-DBMS
Created a "SCHEDULE" database using SQL server DBMS containing  12 mandatory attributes

# Repository content
* Data Folder -- Contains all the tables and RAW Data details
* Schedule_Database sql file 
* ER Diagram
* Logical Data Modeling - Relational Model
* Functional Dependency
* Queries Folder -- Contains all the queries executed
* Query Outout Folder -- Contains all the outputs of the queries run

# Following are the attributes for the database: 
* NetID                   
* StudentName             
* Major
* InstructorName
* InstructorOffice
* GraduationSemester      
* CourseClassroom
* Course#
* CourseName
* CourseBook
* CourseBookPublisher

# Conceptual and Logical Database Design
* Created own business rules and assumptions 
* Identified all functional dependencies in the SCHEDULE database
* Removed all partial and transitive dependencies to create tables in 3NF(Normal Form)
* Assigned appropriate names to all the tables
* Created Entity-Relationship diagram using appropriate cardinality constraints
* Mapped the ER diagram to a relational model showing appropriate referential integrity constraint

# Physical Database Design
* Decided the datatype and size of each attribute in each table
* Decided which attribute should not have a null value
* Using SQL server, created a SCHEDULE database
* Created the schema of each table identified in the Logical Database Design step
* Created the referential integrity constraint for the tables
* Created the database diagram showing the relationship between the tables

# Implementation of the database
* Counted the number of students who are graduating in the same semester
* Displayed the students name and major who have taken BAN 610
* Displayed the NetID and student name of the students who have taken more than 8 courses in year 2019 
* Displayed the NetID and the total credit hours taken by each student in 2019
* Displayed the instructors name and the number of course books prescribed by each instructor
* ---- Queries output can be obtained from folder in the repository --
